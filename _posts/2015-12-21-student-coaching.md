As a coach, my work with students begins with establishing a trusting relationship and the confidence that coaching will be worth the time. 

I support students as they navigate the challenges of balancing academics and other expectations in their lives. My

work with student clients can include anything from managing friendships and interpersonal challenges, to organizational strategies and being an advocate for the student.  Together, we form goals and develop a plan to achieve them. At other times, I provide a listening ear. 

Drawing on best practices in education, my focus is on the process of learning and learning from challenges. 

I bring together my experiences and expertise as a counsellor and as a teacher to help students reach success.  

To find out more about how my student coaching can be of support to you, please get in touch by phone or email.
