Walk and Talk Singapore

Walk and Talk exists to provide professional counselling support for men, women, adolescents and children in an outdoor setting. Some people choose Walk and Talk because they find moving and being outside promotes creative thinking that can help them get "unstuck". Others choose it because they find it easier to have important conversations while walking - speaking in parallel can feel less daunting. Finally, others choose Walk and Talk because it provides an opportunity for exercise while sorting things out. An hour's  walking is a terrific compliment to healthy living.[Click here for more on why Walk and Talk][0]. 

Men, boys and adolescents often find Walk and Talk a good fit because of the relative ease of having important conversations in parallel rather than eye to eye. Walk and Talk is about building on strengths and what already works, so if you have your most important conversations while on the move, Walk and Talk might be right for you.

Finding the right professional that fits is key. Phil Meehan is a Canadian Certified Counsellor who has lived in Singapore for ten years. He works with Singaporean and expat clients. He works with busy professionals, parents, teenagers, adolescents and children.  He has experience working as a counsellor and therapist in private practice and in schools. 

When not in one of Singapore's beautiful parks, sometimes due to the rain, Walk and Talk Singapore is based out of [SACAC Counselling][1] located in the American Club next to Orchard Road. To book an appointment, call us at 6733 9249 or email admin@sacac.sg.
