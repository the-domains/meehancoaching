**Testimonials**

"Talking to Phil helped clear the fog and take a look at my problem objectively. What I liked about it is that we were trying to get somewhere. It wasn't just unloading everything that's going on in my life but how can we get from here to there. When I think of therapy I think of digging deep in the past to see how it's affecting the present. What I thought was interesting about coaching was that it looked to the future and goal setting which is the kind of thing I need to do more of."
