I have a great deal of experience working with children, adolescents and young adults on topics such as depression, anxiety, friendships, anger, self harm, school refusal, self control, self esteem and time management. I began counselling following a teaching career that spanned Canada, New Zealand and Singapore.  

I work extensively with parents on the challenges of raising kids today which include the above topics as well as managing expectations and setting limits for your child and at times other parents, navigating friendships and dealing with screen time, iPads and laptops in a constructive manner.

Finally, I work with busy professionals who are working towards creating balance in their lives. I am particularly interested in helping my clients navigate transitions and change.

I am a Canadian Certified Counsellor (registration number [6193][0]) and I completed my Masters in Counselling from the University of South Australia in 2008\. I use a Solution Focussed approach, having completed my certification as Master Solution Focussed Practitioner from the [Academy of Solution Focussed Training][1] in 2013\. We will spend the majority of our time developing ways to move forward that build on your experiences and expertise.

I have two third culture kids\* who were both born in Singapore. My wife and I have been living overseas for the past eleven years. Like many expats living and working abroad it was only supposed to be for a year, maybe two.

\*Third Culture Kids - Kids raised in a different culture than that of their parents. A must read book by [Pollock and Van Reken][2].
